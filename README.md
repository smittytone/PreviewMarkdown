# PreviewMarkdown 1.0.0 #

A simple app that provides [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) file preview and thumbnailing extensions for macOS 10.15 Catalina and up.

## Installation and Usage ##

Just run the host app once to register the extensions &mdash; you can quit the app as soon as it has launched. We recommend logging out of your Mac and back in again at this point. Now you can preview markdown documents using QuickLook (select an icon and hit Space), and Finderâ€™s preview pane.

You can disable and re-enable the Previewer and Thumbnailer extensions in **System Preferences > Extensions > Quick Look**.
